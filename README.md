# Dialogue Time roadmap

> This is a document intended to inspire the use of project/product roadmaps within Dialogue One A/s

A roadmap is a document or plan that outlines the steps needed to achieve a particular goal. It can be used to guide the development of a product, project, or program, and it can help stakeholders understand the direction and progress of the work.

## Here are some ways a roadmap can be used

1. **Communicate plans and progress:** A roadmap can help stakeholders understand the long-term vision for a product or project, and it can also be used to communicate progress along the way.

2. **Prioritize work:** A roadmap can be used to prioritize work by identifying the most important tasks and focusing resources on those tasks first.

3. **Identify dependencies:** A roadmap can help identify dependencies between tasks, which can help with planning and resource allocation.

4. **Align resources:** A roadmap can be used to align resources with the goals of the project, ensuring that the right people and resources are in place to achieve the desired outcomes.

5. **Manage expectations:** A roadmap can help manage expectations by setting clear goals and communicating progress towards those goals to stakeholders.

## Responsibilities

### Product owner

Product owners are responsible for defining and prioritizing the features and requirements of a product. Here are some steps you can follow to define product owners:

1. **Identify the stakeholders:** The first step in defining product owners is to identify the stakeholders who will be involved in the product development process. This might include customers, users, business owners, and other internal or external stakeholders who have a stake in the product.

2. **Define the product vision:** The product owner should define the long-term vision for the product, including the goals and objectives that the product is intended to achieve. This vision should be aligned with the needs and goals of the stakeholders.

7. **Manage project changes:** Project managers are responsible for managing changes to the project, including evaluating the impact of the changes and ensuring that they are properly implemented.

### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a stake or interest in a project or product. They can be internal or external to the organization, and they can include customers, users, business owners, shareholders, employees, and other interested parties.

Here are some key responsibilities of stakeholders:

1. **Communicate needs and expectations:** Stakeholders are responsible for communicating their needs and expectations to the project team, including any specific requirements or constraints that must be considered during the project.

2. **Provide resources:** Stakeholders may be responsible for providing resources to support the project, including budget, staff, or other materials.

3. **Review and approve plans:** Stakeholders may be involved in reviewing and approving project plans and other key documents, such as budgets and schedules.

4. **Provide feedback:** Stakeholders are encouraged to provide feedback on the project, including suggestions for improvements or concerns about the project's direction.

5. **Support the project:** Stakeholders are expected to support the project and help ensure its success, including by providing resources and collaborating with the project team.

## Risk management
Risk management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and addressing risks that may impact a project. Here is an example of a risk management methodology that you can follow:

1. **Identify risks:** The first step in the risk management process is to identify risks that may impact the project. This might involve conducting a risk assessment to identify potential risks, as well as soliciting input from team members and stakeholders.

2. **Analyze risks:** Once you have identified the risks, the next step is to analyze them in order to understand their potential impact on the project. This might involve evaluating the likelihood and severity of each risk, as well as the potential consequences of the risk occurring.

3. **Prioritize risks:** Based on the analysis, you should prioritize the risks based on their likelihood and impact. This will help you focus your efforts on the most critical risks and ensure that they are addressed first.

4. **Develop a risk response plan:** Once you have identified and prioritized the risks, you should develop a risk response plan to address them. This might involve implementing risk mitigation measures, such as adding additional resources or developing contingency plans, or accepting the risk and developing a plan to manage it.

5. **Monitor and review risks:** As the project progresses, it is important to regularly monitor and review the risks to ensure that they are being effectively managed. This might involve updating the risk response plan as needed and implementing additional risk management measures as needed.

## Resource plan
A resource plan is a document that outlines the resources (such as staff, budget, materials, and equipment) that will be required to complete a project. Here is an example of how you might go about creating a resource plan:

1. **Identify the resources needed:** The first step in creating a resource plan is to identify the resources that will be required to complete the project. This might include identifying the staff and expertise needed, as well as any budget, materials, or equipment that will be required.

2. **Assign tasks and resources:** Next, you will need to assign tasks to team members and allocate the necessary resources to support the work. This might involve identifying the skills and expertise required for each task and ensuring that the appropriate team members are assigned to the work.

3. **Estimate resource requirements:** Based on the tasks and resources assigned, you will need to estimate the resource requirements for the project. This might involve estimating the amount of time and effort that will be required for each task, as well as the cost of any materials or equipment that will be needed.

4. **Create a resource budget:** Using the resource requirements that you have estimated, you can create a resource budget that outlines the total cost of the resources needed for the project.

5. **Monitor and control resources:** As the project progresses, it is important to monitor and control the resources to ensure that they are being used effectively and efficiently. This might involve tracking resource usage and adjusting the resource plan as needed to ensure that the project stays on track.

## Product Requirements

Product requirements are the characteristics and features that a product must have in order to meet the needs of its users and stakeholders. They can include both functional requirements, which describe the specific actions or capabilities that the product should be able to perform, and non-functional requirements, which describe the overall qualities and characteristics that the product should possess.

### Functional
Functional requirements are specific, measurable, and objective, and they describe the functions or capabilities that the product should be able to perform. Examples of functional requirements might include:

- The ability to search for and display specific information
- The ability to save and retrieve data
- The ability to process transactions or calculations
- The ability to interact with other systems or devices

### Non-functional
Non-functional requirements, on the other hand, describe the overall characteristics and qualities of the product, rather than specific actions or capabilities. Examples of non-functional requirements might include:

- Performance requirements, such as response time or throughput
- Security requirements, such as data encryption or user authentication
- Usability requirements, such as user interface design or ease of use
- Compatibility requirements, such as the ability to run on different operating systems or devices

It is important to consider both functional and non-functional requirements when designing and developing a product, as they both contribute to the overall user experience and effectiveness of the product.

## Product dependencies

Product dependencies are the items or resources that a product relies on in order to function correctly. They can include things like:

- Other products or services that the product needs in order to work
- External libraries or frameworks that the product uses
- Hardware or infrastructure that the product requires
- People or teams that the product relies on for support or maintenance

Product dependencies can be internal or external to an organization. Internal dependencies might include other products or services developed by the same team or organization, while external dependencies might include products or services developed by other companies or organizations.

Managing product dependencies is an important part of product development and maintenance. Properly identifying and tracking dependencies can help ensure that a product has the resources it needs to function correctly, and can also help identify potential issues or risks that may impact the product. It is important to regularly review and assess product dependencies in order to ensure that they are still relevant and necessary, and to identify any potential changes or updates that may be needed.
