> # Learning Modules

## Program 1: Frameworks and Methodologies

Each week is focused on several topics and the entire module is expected to be completed in a period of two weeks. The module covers an introduction to the different frameworks and methodologies used in software design, with a focus on Design Thinking, Human (User) Centered Design, Agile Development, DevOps, Information Architecture, and Scrum. Participants will gain an understanding of each approach and learn how they can be applied to software design projects. The final week includes a final project and assessment to test understanding and application of the topics covered throughout the module.
