> # Code Documentation

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the backend and frontend codebase of the Project Status plugin developed by Dialogue One A/S. The purpose of this guide is to provide a detailed understanding of the code structure, how different components of the system interact with each other, and how to make changes or additions to the code.

The document is divided into two main sections: Backend and Frontend. The backend section covers the server-side code written in Node.js and the frontend section covers the client-side code written in JavaScript and React.
