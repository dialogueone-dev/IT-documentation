# Project Status

Welcome to the documentation for the Excel plugin created by Dialogue One A/s. This plugin is designed to replace exporting and importing excel sheets into the Project Status xlsm file.

The plugin is based on the [Office-Add-in-NodeJS-SSO](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples/tree/main/Samples/auth/Office-Add-in-NodeJS-SSO) Github repository, which provides a foundation for implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication in Office add-ins using Node.js.

By using this plugin, you can avoid the need to log into  Dialogue Time to export data to Excel and import it into your Excel file. The plugin retrieves the data from the API and automatically populates it into two sheets within your Excel file. In this documentation, you will find information on how to install and use the Excel plugin, as well as detailed instructions on how to customize and configure the plugin to meet your specific needs. If you have any questions or issues while using the plugin, please refer to the troubleshooting section or contact ies@dialogueone.dk for assistance.
