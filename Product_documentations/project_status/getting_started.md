# Getting started

## Requirements

- Microsoft Excel
- An account on Dialogue One A/s active directory with the necessary permissions to access the API.

## Installation

If you have an account on Dialogue One A/s active directory, you should be able to see the plugin in the "Add-ins" tab of the Excel ribbon. If you do not see the plugin, follow these steps to install it:

1. Download the plugin file from [insert location where plugin can be downloaded, e.g. Github, company website, etc.]
2. Open Microsoft Excel
3. Click on "File" and then "Options"
4. Select "Add-ins" from the left-hand menu
5. Click on the "Manage" dropdown menu and select "Excel Add-ins"
6. Click on "Browse" and select the plugin file you downloaded in step 1
7. Click "OK" to install the plugin
8. The plugin will now appear in the "Add-ins" tab of the Excel ribbon

## Authentication

The plugin uses Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication to access the API. Meaning it should automatically log you in if you are already logged in to your Dialogue One A/s account. If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to log in when you open the plugin.
