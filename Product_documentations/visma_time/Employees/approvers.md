# Managing Approvers in Visma Time

Hours in Visma Time must be approved before they are sent to Visma Løn.

> There are four levels of approvers: First, second, third, and final approver.

The first, second, and third approvers depend on the department, while Ole Klitgaard is the only final approver. Once the hours are finally approved, they can no longer be edited and can no longer be approved by a lower-level approver. This means that if a report, for example, is approved by the third approver, it can no longer be approved by the first or second approver.

#### How to Edit Approver Level for Employees

The level of approver is assigned to the employee. To edit this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to "Medarbejdere".
2. Right-click on the employee whose approver level you want to change and select "Rediger".
3. Under "Vælg godkender niveau," select the desired approver level **or** click the cross to remove the approver level.
4. Select "Gem".

**Or**

2. Select all employees who should be assigned the same approver level.
3. In the black bar at the bottom of the page, select "Vælg godkender niveau".
4. Choose the approver level from the dropdown menu and select "Gem".

#### How to Assign/Remove Approvers for Departments
