# How to Set Up Standard Time

To calculate flex time, standard time (normtid) must be set up for salaried employees. This is done as follows:

1. Navigate to "Planlægning".
2. Click on the blue plus sign at the bottom right corner and select "Opret normtid" _or_ find the employee for whom you want to create standard time and click on any day next to the employee.
3. Make sure the correct employee is selected.
4. Under "Arbejdskategori", select "Arbejdstid".
5. A new field will now appear, "Vælg arbejdstype", where "Arbejdstid" should be selected.
6. Select "Fra dato" (this will typically be set to the employee's first working day).
7. Enter the number of hours under "Antal".
8. Under "Vælg vagt", choose "Fleks" - **important, as flex time will not be calculated otherwise** (however, this is not filled for employees in "fleksjob").
9. Check the box "Planen fortsætter uendeligt".
10. Under "Gentag?" select the days for which the standard time should _not_ apply (i.e., Saturday and Sunday).
11. Select "Gem".
