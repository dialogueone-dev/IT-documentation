# Handling New Employees

There are two ways of creating new employees in Visma Time, depending on whether they already have a CPR number or not.  
Once the employee is created, they need to be added to the correct department.

> [!NOTE]
> The email must be filled in Visma Løn for the employee to be created (as the email is used as the username in order to use Microsoft SSO).

### The New Employee has a CPR Number

If the new employee has a CPR number, they should first be created in Visma Løn and will then appear under "Nye lønmodtagere" in "Medarbejdere" in Visma Time. The employee should then be created in Visma Time as follows:

1. Navigate to "Nye medarbejdere" under "Medarbejdere".
2. Select the new employee and choose "Opret" in the black bar at the bottom of the page or right-click on the employee and select "Opret".
3. Check the box "Brug lønmodtager email som brugernavn".
4. Select "Arbejdsmodel" and "Arbejdstidsaftale".
5. Select the start date.
6. Click "Opret".

### The New Employee does not have a CPR Number

If the new employee does not have a CPR number, they must be manually created in Visma Time. This is done by selecting "Medarbejdere" in the menu and then clicking the blue plus sign in the bottom right corner and filling out the employees' information.

Once they have received a CPR number and are created in Visma Løn, the following steps should be taken:

1. Navigate to "Medarbejdere".
2. Double-click on the employee and select the "Kontrakter" tab.
3. Double-click on the existing contract.
4. Under "Lønmodtager navn", select the relevant employee.
5. Save the changes.

### Adding the New Employee to a Department

Once the employee is created, they must be added to the correct department. This is done by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Medarbejdere" tab.
2. Right-click on the desired employee and select "Rediger".
3. In the "Afdeling" field, select the desired department.
4. Select "Gem".

> Remember to set up the standard working hours (normtid) for salaried employees.
