# How to Create a New Sub-Project in Visma Time

When the project is created, it will appear in the overview of all projects, grouped by client. To create sub-projects (tasks/processes), follow these steps:

1. Double-click on the project.
2. Under the "Underprojekter" tab, click the blue plus sign at the bottom right corner and select "Opret projekt".
3. Make sure the client name is correct.
4. Fill in the "Projektnavn", e.g., "Calling."
5. Ensure that the "Hovedprojekt" is correct.
6. Ensure that the "Projektgruppe" is correct.
7. Uncheck "Åben for alle medarbejdere" (unless the sub-project should be accessible to all employees).
8. Uncheck "Åben for alle aktiviteter".
9. Select "Gem".

Below is a list of sub-projects that an **external** project should include:

- Calling
- Project lead
- Internal client meeting
- Training/coaching received
- Support training/QC
- Technical problem
- Project administration support
- Project development
- Database development
- Database maintenance

> [!NOTE]
> Since sub-projects refer to tasks/processes, the naming of sub-projects should, as much as possible, follow this convention. This means that the sub-project's name should be an activity that can be performed, such as "Calling" or "Project Development."
