# Employee Access in Visma Time

When the project and sub-projects are created, employee access must be managed for both the project and the sub-projects.

Employee access can be granted to a department or specific employees.

> Where possible, access is granted at the department level; otherwise, it is granted at the employee level.

For example, for external projects, access to the sub-project "Project Administration Support" is granted at the department level to departments 202 - Client and Project Services - S&M Accounts, 300 - HR and Project Operation, 301 - HR Support, and 303 - Project Support while access to the sub-project "Calling" is granted at the employee level to the employees working on that project.

> Employee access must be granted for both the project and the sub-projects.

On the project, access must be given to all departments and employees who need to log hours on the sub-projects, and on each sub-project, access must be granted to the departments and employees who need to log hours on that specific sub-project.
