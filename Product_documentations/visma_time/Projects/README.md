# Projects in Visma Time

Employees must log their hours in Visma Time on the project(s) they have worked on.

The projects are set up according to the structure:  
**Client → Project → Task/process** (in Visma Time, the task/process is a **sub-project**).

Projects in Visma Time can be divided into two main categories: external and internal.

**External projects** are carried out for a client and will typically have sub-projects (tasks/processes) such as "Calling", "Project administration support" and "Database maintenance" (detailed description in the following pages).

**Internal projects** involve everything that is performed internally in Dialogue One, and here it depends on the main project whether there should be sub-projects and, if so, which ones.  
When creating new projects please note that for internal projects, the client is Dialogue One A/S.

> When creating new projects in Visma Time, the following steps are taken:  
> Create project → Create sub-projects → Manage employee access → Assign activities

> [!NOTE]
> Both the **project and sub-projects must have employee access and activities assigned**, otherwise they will not be available for time registration.

In the following pages we will dive deeper into these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Clients are created and maintained in e-conomic and should therefore not be changed in Visma Time. For questions or errors regarding this, please contact Linda Guldbrandsen (lgb@dialogueone.dk).
