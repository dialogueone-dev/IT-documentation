# Closing/Resuming a Project

When a project is completed, it should be made inactive in Visma Time to keep the system as organized as possible.  
This can be done as follows:

1. Navigate to "Projekter".
2. Right-click on the desired project and select "Rediger".
3. Turn off "Aktiv".
4. Select "Gem".

_Or_

1. Check the desired project(s).
2. In the black bar at the bottom of the page, select "Deaktiver".

The project is now inactive and no longer available for time reporting. However, previous reports will still be displayed as before. In e-conomic, the project will be marked as "Sp√¶rret". The synchronization with e-conomic is bidirectional, meaning that if a project is blocked in e-conomic, it will be set as inactive in Visma Time.

If the project needs to be **reactivated**, follow the above steps, but turn on "Aktiv"/select "Aktiver" instead.
