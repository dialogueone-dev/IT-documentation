## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

Below is a list of some common errors and how they can be resolved.

### Project is not Available for Time Reporting

If a project is not available when reporting time, the cause could be due to several factors:

**Projects Are Not Updated in the Browser/App**
Refreshing the page or app ensures that the projects the employee has access to are up to date. In the app, pull down from the top to refresh.

**Employee access on the project and sub-project**  
Make sure the [department has access](Product_documentations/visma_time/Projects/employee_access.md) to both the project and sub-project.

**Department on the employee**  
Make sure the [employee is added to the correct department](Product_documentations/visma_time/Employees/new_employees.md#adding-the-new-employee-to-a-department).

**Activities on the project and sub-project**  
Make sure [activities (e.g., "Arbejdstid") are added](Product_documentations/visma_time/Projects/activities.md) to both the project and sub-project.

**The project's status**  
Make sure the [project is active](Product_documentations/visma_time/Projects/closing_project.md).

If none of the above work, refer to [Visma's own guidelines](https://community.visma.com/t5/Vejledninger-i-Visma-Time/tkb-p/DK_EN_Visma-Time_Vejledninger) or contact [Visma's support](https://vismaenterpriseas.my.site.com) for additional help and assistance.
