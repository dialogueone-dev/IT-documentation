## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

Below is a list of some common errors and how they can be resolved.

### Project is not Available for Time Reporting

If a project does not appear in the dropdown menu of available projects when reporting time, the cause could be due to several factors:

**Employee access on the project and sub-project**  
Make sure the [department/employee has access](Product_documentations/visma_time/Projects/employee_access.md) to both the project and sub-project.

**Activities on the project and sub-project**  
Make sure [activities (e.g., "Arbejdstid") are added](Product_documentations/visma_time/Projects/activities.md) to both the project and sub-project.

**The project's status**  
Make sure the [project is active]()

If none of the above work, refer to [Visma's own guidelines](https://community.visma.com/t5/Vejledninger-i-Visma-Time/tkb-p/DK_EN_Visma-Time_Vejledninger) or contact [Visma's support](https://vismaenterpriseas.my.site.com) for additional help and assistance.

### Error in Integration with Visma Løn or e-conomic

If there is an error in the integration with either Visma Løn or e-conomic, it will be displayed on the dashboard in Visma Time, as shown in the image below. To correct the error, open a ticket in the [customer portal](https://vismaenterpriseas.my.site.com) with information about where the error is. In the example below, the error is in the **synchronization** within the integration with **e-conomic**. Visma will then address the issue.
