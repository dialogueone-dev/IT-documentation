# Getting Started with Ninox

To access Ninox, please visit [https://ninox.dialogueone.com](https://ninox.dialogueone.com).

## Installation

Ninox is a web-based application that runs on all browsers, so there is no need to install Ninox itself. However, specific browser recommendations and additional tools may be required for optimal functionality.

### Browser Recommendations

- **Windows OS**: Firefox is recommended or even necessary for Windows users to utilize the `mailto` links, which open the Outlook application with prefilled information.
- **Mac OS**: Chrome should work on Mac OS.

If you are using Windows, please install the Firefox browser.

### Microsoft 365

If you are using your personal computer, you may install Office 365 to access Microsoft Outlook, Teams, etc. This ensures compatibility with Ninox.

[See the installation instructions for Microsoft 365 here.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/download-and-install-or-reinstall-microsoft-365-or-office-2021-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658)

### Usage Environment

Since we aim to move away from the Remote Desktop environment, please follow these instructions on your local computer rather than on the remote desktop.

## Setting Up Ninox

To make the automations work as intended, a few settings need to be updated.

### Allowing Pop-ups in Firefox

1. Go to `Settings->Search` in Firefox.
2. Search for "Pop-up" and click on the `Exceptionsâ€¦` button.
3. Add `https://ninox.dialogueone.com` by copying and pasting the link into `Address of website`.
4. Click on the `Allow` button, then save the changes.

### Setting Default Applications

When clicking a button in Ninox that initiates a transfer to another application (e.g., Email, Phone), the browser's inbuilt functionality takes over.

#### Default Firefox Applications

- **Email**: To set Outlook as the default email application, go to `Settings->Search`, type "mailto," and select `Use Outlook`.
- **Phone**: To set the default phone application (e.g., IP Visions Connect software), follow the same steps as above.

#### Default Windows Applications

- **Windows 11**: Navigate to `Settings->Apps->Default apps`, then choose `Choose defaults by link type`. Search for `mailto` and `tel`, and select the desired applications.
- **Windows 10**: Navigate to `Settings->Apps->Default apps`, then select `Choose default apps by protocol`. Scroll down to find `mailto` or `tel`.
