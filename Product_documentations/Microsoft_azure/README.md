> # Microsoft SSO Projects

Our company utilizes Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication across various projects.

Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management solution that provides a seamless and secure SSO experience for users. With Azure AD, users can sign in once and access multiple applications without the need to provide credentials again. This helps to simplify the user experience and increase productivity, while also ensuring security and compliance.

> For more information on Azure AD, see the [Azure AD documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/).

Below is an high level overview of the Azure AD SSO process:

## Configuring Azure AD for SSO

To configure Azure AD for SSO, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Azure AD tenant**: Sign in to the Azure AD portal using this link [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. **Register your application**: Register your application in Azure AD by providing information such as the application name, redirect URI, and application type.
3. **Configure SSO settings**: Configure SSO settings for your application, such as the SAML configuration, user attributes, and authentication methods.
4. **Test SSO**: Test SSO by logging in to your application using Azure AD credentials.

## Using Azure AD for SSO

Once Azure AD is configured for SSO, users can easily log in to your application using their Azure AD credentials. To enable Azure AD SSO in your application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Azure AD as an identity provider**: Add Azure AD as an identity provider in your application by providing the Azure AD tenant ID, client ID, and client secret.
