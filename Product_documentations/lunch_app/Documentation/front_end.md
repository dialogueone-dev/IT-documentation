> # Front End

The front-end of the application is designed using the MaterializeCSS library. MaterializeCSS is a responsive front-end framework based on Material Design guidelines. The framework provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript components, which can be used to build a modern and user-friendly interface.

The PHP application is structured as follows:

- Views Folder: The Views folder contains PHP HTML files that display all relevant information to the front-end. This includes:
  - Product Components: A PHP HTML file that displays all available product components.
  - Suppliers: A PHP HTML file that displays all available suppliers.
  - Admin Login: A PHP HTML file that displays a login form for administrators.
  - Edit Products: A PHP HTML file that displays a form for editing product information.
  - Edit Suppliers: A PHP HTML file that displays a form for editing supplier information.
  - Header: A PHP HTML file that displays the header for the application.
  - Footer: A PHP HTML file that displays the footer for the application.
  - My Purchases: A PHP HTML file that displays a list of purchases made by the current user.
  - Purchase Report: A PHP HTML file that displays a report of all purchases made in the canteen.
  - Registration: A PHP HTML file that displays a registration form for new users.
  - Checkout: A PHP HTML file that displays a checkout form for users to purchase products.
  - Index Page: A PHP HTML file that displays the main page of the application.

Each PHP HTML file is designed to be modular and reusable, making it easy to maintain and update the application over time. By separating the front-end and back-end code, the application is easier to manage and can be updated independently.

In the next section, we will discuss the back-end structure of the application, which includes the use of Microsoft MSAL library and MySQL database.
