> # Front-end

**Introduction**

Welcome to the front-end architecture documentation for Dialogue Time. In this guide, we'll be discussing the various technologies, patterns, and best practices used to build the front-end of our web application.

The front-end of a web application is the part that users interact with directly, and it's responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user input, and communicating with the back-end. A well-designed front-end architecture is crucial for ensuring a smooth, responsive user experience and for enabling efficient development and maintenance of the application.

Our front-end architecture is based on React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We've also utilized other technologies such as Axios and Redux to streamline our development process and enhance our application's functionality.

In this guide, we'll cover topics such as:

- Data flow through the component tree using React hooks and contexts
- The Flux pattern and how we use it with Redux to manage application state
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and how we've implemented them for our web application
- Best practices for structuring components and managing data services
- And much more!

We hope this guide will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of our front-end architecture and enable you to contribute effectively to the development of our web application. Let's dive in!
