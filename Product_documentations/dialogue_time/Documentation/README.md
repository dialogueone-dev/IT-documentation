I chose JavaScript as the main tech stack for the project, as I believed it to be the most cost-effective choice.
Using React JS and the Material UI library, I would be able to quickly develop and launch new components using
tried and tested code. The popularity of these frameworks also meant that I would easily find solutions to any
issues I might face during the development. Furthermore, the Back-end is a Node.js framework which boasts
much popularity.
