> # Documentation

Welcome to the code documentation for the Dialogue Time application. This documentation provides detailed information about the front end and back end code of the application. It is intended for developers who are working on maintaining, extending, or troubleshooting the application.

## Front End (React.js) {docsify-ignore}

The front end of the Dialogue Time application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js allows for the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates the development of interactive and responsive user interfaces.

In the front end code documentation, you will find information about the structure, components, and functionality of the React.js codebase. It covers topics such as:

- Component hierarchy and organization
- State management using React's state and props
- Routing and navigation using React Router
- API integration for data retrieval and updates
- Event handling and form submission
- Styling and CSS frameworks utilized

The documentation aims to provide an overview of the front end codebase and guide developers in understanding and modifying the user interface of the Dialogue Time application.

## Back End (Node.js) {docsify-ignore}

The back end of the Dialogue Time application is developed using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment known for its scalability and efficiency in building server-side applications. Node.js allows for the development of robust and performant server-side code.

In the back end code documentation, you will find information about the architecture, modules, and functionality of the Node.js codebase. It covers topics such as:

- Routing and handling HTTP requests using Express.js
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Database integration and data modeling
- Business logic implementation
- External service integrations
- Error handling and logging

The documentation aims to provide insights into the back end implementation of the Dialogue Time application and assist developers in enhancing or troubleshooting the server-side functionality.
