> # Backend

**Introduction**

The backend architecture of the Dialogue Time application is designed to handle the data processing and storage needed for the application's functionality. It is built using modern web development technologies, including Node.js and Express.js, and follows a RESTful API design pattern for communication between the frontend and backend.

**Key Components**

The backend architecture comprises several key components, including:

- Node.js: The runtime environment used to run the backend application code.
- Express.js: The web application framework used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- MongoDB: The NoSQL database used to store and manage application data.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB used to define schemas and models for data storage.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWTs): Used for authentication and authorization of users, with tokens generated on the backend and sent to the frontend for secure communication.
- RESTful API: The backend follows a RESTful API design pattern for communication with the frontend, allowing for a clear and standardized interface between the two.

**Backend Functionality**

The backend is responsible for several key functionalities within the application, including:

- User management: Handling authentication, and authorization of user accounts.
- Data storage and retrieval: Storing and retrieving application data from the MYSQL and MongoDB database.
- Business logic: Implementing application-specific business logic, such as calculating user activity metrics or processing log data.
