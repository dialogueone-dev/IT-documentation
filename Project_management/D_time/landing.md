> In this section, you will see how Dialogue Time project planning is made and how it is managed.

## Product description

Dialogue Time is a website developed in-house for tracking hours and schedules. It was named by popular vote and is built using the LAMP stack. The website was created from scratch as a central system, and it is considered a "sovereign-posture application," meaning it occupies users' attention for extended periods of time and offers a wide range of functions and features. Users tend to keep the website open and running continuously, occupying the full screen.

### Project name

Dialouge Time Development

## Project scope

To implement an API first full-stack solution using industry-standard techniques and tools, integrating the applications with third party SaaS where correlation exists.

The scope of which includes:

- A new user management and authentication process.
- Increased GDPR compliance and security.
- Increased automation and efficiency.
- Improved UI/UX
- Improvement and creation of new features • Reduced administrative overhead.

## Impact

Integrating API connections between the third party software used by Dialogue One A/S is expected to reduce administrative overhead by eliminating redundant tasks. There are user management and project management processes in all departments that could be made more efficient by using a single software with single sign-on (SSO) instead of multiple tools. This is likely to lead to a reduction in redundancy and make these processes more streamlined.

### Automation

The need for creating a centralized application comes from the company’s recent growth; departments are experiencing more administrative overhead, which might otherwise be automated to increase efficiency.

This automation includes:

- Automatic deletion of personal data in all systems.
- Actions that trigger programmed features like sending an email.
- Access to personal information, allowing consultants to update their info without involving HR.
- Automatic KPI calculations.
- A single user management system from On-boarding to Off-boarding.
- A more advanced payroll system.

### Improved Services

The integration allows the product to offer better services to the target group by relieving overhead and offering new features that support sales. It potentially creates an opportunity for Dialogue One to develop a new business model, expanding its sales operations into the SaaS market by providing API services.
