> # Project Planning

In this section you will find a high level plan on how to plan out a project, in this section the Remote Desktop project is used as an example.

## Drawing up a project plan
Here is an example of a detailed project plan for shutting down remote desktops and moving data from them into Sharepoint:

**Step 1:** Define the project scope
- Identify the remote desktop systems that will be shut down
- Identify the data that needs to be moved from the remote desktops to Sharepoint
- Identify the stakeholders who need to be involved in the process, including IT staff and end users

**Step 2:** Identify tasks and dependencies
- Create a plan for moving data from the remote desktops to Sharepoint, including any necessary data mapping or transformation
- Communicate the shutdown plan to stakeholders, including end users and IT staff
- Train team members on how to use Sharepoint
- Set up Sharepoint sites and permissions for the data that will be moved
- Backup the data on the remote desktop systems
- Test the data migration process to ensure that all data is moved correctly
- Shut down the remote desktop systems

**Step 3:** Assign resources
- Identify the team members who will be responsible for completing each task
- Allocate any necessary budget or resources to support the project

**Step 4:** Create a timeline
- Set target completion dates for each task based on the dependencies identified in Step 2
- Use the timeline to create a project schedule that includes milestones and deliverables

**Step 5:** Track progress
- Use project management software, such as Microsoft Project or Trello, to track progress and ensure that tasks are being completed on schedule
- Create reports or use dashboard views to see how the project is progressing

**Step 6:** Communicate with stakeholders
- Share updates and reports with stakeholders to keep them informed of progress
- Hold regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss the project and address any issues that may arise

## Data mapping
Data mapping is the process of defining the relationships between data elements in different systems or sources. It is often used to facilitate data transfer or integration between systems, and it helps ensure that data is correctly translated and stored in the appropriate format.

There are a number of different techniques that can be used for data mapping, including:

1. **Manual data mapping:** This involves manually defining the relationships between data elements in different systems or sources. This can be a time-consuming process, but it can be useful when working with small amounts of data or when the data sources are relatively simple.

2. **Automated data mapping:** Automated data mapping tools use algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify relationships between data elements in different systems or sources. These tools can be faster and more efficient than manual data mapping, but they may not be as precise and may require additional configuration or training.

3. **Data mapping models:** Data mapping models define the relationships between data elements in a formal, structured way. These models can be used to represent the relationships between data elements in a visual or graphical format, making it easier to understand and communicate the mapping process.

4. **Data mapping standards:** Data mapping standards define the conventions and best practices for defining data relationships and transferring data between systems. These standards can help ensure that data is consistently mapped and transferred between systems, which can improve the quality and reliability of the data.

## To keep in mind

Here are a few things that might be useful to keep in mind when planning a project to shut down remote desktops and move data from them into Sharepoint:

1. **Data quality:** It is important to ensure that the data being moved from the remote desktops to Sharepoint is of high quality. This might involve cleaning and verifying the data before it is migrated, as well as defining and enforcing data standards to ensure that the data is consistent and accurate.

2. **Data security:** Ensuring the security of the data being moved is also important. This might involve implementing additional security measures, such as encryption or access controls, to protect the data as it is being transferred.

3. **Data governance:** Ensuring that the data being moved is properly governed is also important. This might involve defining policies and procedures for managing the data, as well as establishing roles and responsibilities for data stewardship.

4. **Stakeholder engagement:** It is important to engage with stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed. This might involve holding regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss progress and address any issues that may arise.

5. **Risk management:** It is important to identify and manage any risks that may arise during the project. This might involve identifying potential risks and developing contingency plans to address them, as well as regularly reviewing and updating the risk management plan as the project progresses.
