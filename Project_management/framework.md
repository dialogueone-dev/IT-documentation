> # Frameworks

There are many different frameworks that can be used to manage projects and stakeholders. The best framework for your project will depend on a number of factors, including the size and complexity of the project, the nature of the work, and the needs and goals of the stakeholders.

Some popular project management frameworks include:

1. **Agile:** Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes collaboration, continuous improvement, and rapid delivery. It is well-suited for projects with complex or rapidly changing requirements.

2. **Waterfall:** Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to project management that involves completing one phase of the project before moving on to the next. It is well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear end goal.

3. **Lean:** Lean is a project management approach that emphasizes efficiency and continuous improvement. It is based on the principles of the Toyota Production System and is well-suited for projects with a focus on maximizing value and minimizing waste.

4. **Six Sigma:** Six Sigma is a data-driven approach to project management that emphasizes the use of statistical analysis and rigorous process control to identify and eliminate defects. It is well-suited for projects with a focus on quality and continuous improvement.

Regardless of the framework you choose, it is important to regularly review and adjust your approach as needed to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the project and the stakeholders.
