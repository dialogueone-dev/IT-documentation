## What is Human Centered Design

Human (User) Centered Design is an approach to design that puts the needs, preferences, and behaviors of users at the forefront of the design process. It involves understanding the people who will be using a product or service, their goals, their motivations, and their limitations, and using that understanding to inform design decisions.

The approach is based on the idea that design solutions are most effective when they are tailored to the needs and experiences of the people who will be using them. Human-centered design involves a deep understanding of users through research techniques such as interviews, surveys, and observations. The insights from this research are used to inform the design process and ensure that the resulting product or service is effective, efficient, and enjoyable to use.

The human-centered design process typically involves three phases: discovery, ideation, and prototyping. During the discovery phase, designers conduct research to understand the needs and preferences of users. In the ideation phase, designers use the insights from their research to generate and refine ideas for solutions that meet those needs. Finally, in the prototyping phase, designers create low-fidelity versions of their ideas to test with users and gather feedback, which is used to refine and improve the design.

Human-centered design is used in a wide range of fields, including product design, software development, healthcare, and education. It is especially useful for creating products and services that are easy to use and meet the needs of a diverse range of users.
