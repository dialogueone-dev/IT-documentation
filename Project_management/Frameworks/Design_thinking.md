## What is Design thinking

Design thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that focuses on understanding the needs and perspectives of users or customers, generating creative ideas, and testing and refining those ideas through iterative cycles of prototyping and feedback.

The process typically involves five stages: empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test. In the empathy stage, designers seek to understand the user or customer's needs, desires, and challenges through interviews, observations, and other forms of research. In the define stage, designers use this information to develop a clear problem statement that captures the essence of the challenge they are trying to solve.

In the ideate stage, designers generate a wide range of potential solutions to the problem through brainstorming and other creative techniques. In the prototype stage, designers create rough, low-fidelity versions of their ideas, such as sketches or mockups, to test and refine their concepts. Finally, in the test stage, designers gather feedback from users or customers on their prototypes, refine their ideas based on this feedback, and repeat the prototyping and testing cycle until they arrive at a final solution.

Design thinking can be used to address a wide range of challenges, from creating new products and services to improving existing ones, to solving complex social or environmental problems. It is often used in fields such as product design, software development, and marketing, as well as in healthcare, education, and social innovation.
