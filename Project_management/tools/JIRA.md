1. **Create a roadmap in Jira:** Jira provides a roadmap feature that allows you to create a visual representation of the planned work for a product or project. You can use this feature to define the high-level goals and objectives of the work, and then break those down into smaller, more manageable tasks.

2. **Use Jira epics to represent high-level goals:** In Jira, you can use epics to represent high-level goals or objectives on your roadmap. Epics can be broken down into smaller tasks, called stories, which can be assigned to team members and tracked through the development process.

3. U**se Jira filters to view specific parts of the roadmap:** Jira's filter functionality allows you to view specific parts of the roadmap, such as tasks assigned to a specific team member or tasks with a certain priority level. This can be useful for getting a focused view of the work that needs to be done.

4. **Use Jira to track progress:** Jira provides a number of tools for tracking progress, including burn-down charts and velocity charts. These charts can help you see how quickly work is being completed and whether you are on track to meet your goals.

5. **Use Jira to communicate with stakeholders:** Jira provides a number of tools for communicating with stakeholders, including the ability to create and share reports, as well as the ability to collaborate with team members and stakeholders in real-time using tools such as chat and video conferencing.
